# stock-word-performance

Track the performance of stocks containing a particular word over time!


## Developer Notes

I have omitted the stock data as well as the scraping scripts.    
This repository is more so you can see how the website works under the hood.    
However, if you have your own daily stock data and you format it according to `db-generators/schema.sql`, then you will be able to run this project yourself!    
(Note that you will need the historical data in addition to the metadata).

## Installation

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

sudo apt install python3-psycopg2
